* Starting Org mode
** Our first Org document
You have to start each org document as shown above, =Title -*- mode: org -*-=
This will anable Org mode for this document, no matter what the file-ending is
I guess if you have a .Org document already, you don't need the title however, if you're converting between md files and txt files, the tile might be useful to show that its org mode
