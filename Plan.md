Since I've been so bored, I've decided to learn vanila emacs, i'm currently editing this file in emacs.
I've just opened this file using the chords, ctrl-x ctrl-f. I guess from now on C will represent the ctrl key
This stuff really does remind me of nano

I'm going to save this file now using C-x C-s

i Guess I should just write down important commands, maybe i'll make a new file
